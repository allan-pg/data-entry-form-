# Data Entry Form in Excel

## Introduction
During an event it would not only be tiresome but stressful to record attendance manually but with this automated excel form it would be muc easier to record all attendees.
I have used only excel to work on the form.
The form is protected in excel to prevent unauthorised editing of the form
By use of the developer tab on excel

the form records data and the data is saved on a separate sheet after the user submits his or her information details.
