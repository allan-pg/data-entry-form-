# Data Entry Form in Excel

## Introduction
During an event it would not only be tiresome but stressful to record attendance manually but with this automated excel form it would be muc easier to record all attendees.
I have used only excel to work on the form.

### Protecting your sheet 
The form is protected in excel to prevent unauthorised editing of the form

Select the column you want to protect, right Click-> Format Cells->Protection, and select the "Locked" check box. Review tab->Protect Sheet, select the "Protect worksheet and contents of locked cells" check box and protect the sheet using a password

### Automatin your form
By use of the developer tab on excel

the form records data and the data is saved on a separate sheet after the user submits his or her information details.

### Conclusion
This data entry form has been made entirely on excel and is great for obtaining data from your users or attendees to an event.
